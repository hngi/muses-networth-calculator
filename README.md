# Muses Net Worth Calculator

## Overview

This is one of the stage 3 projects built by Team Muses. A Net Worth Calculator web app. This is not just an average Networth calculator ðŸ™‚. Our Networth calculator enables users to login an register if they don't have an account. Users can add several assets and liabilities they have and they will be supplied with the following information on clicking on "calculate" or clicking on the link to the  statistics page.

- The total sum of their assets
- The total sum of their liabilities
- Their total Networth
- Their percentile globally

## Other features

Users can add, delete or update their various liabilities or assets. They can also search and filter items by dated added, value or description. A user can choose to logout and will be taken back to the home page and will need to login again to access their dashboard. 

## Technology used

We built a Node.js/Express powered REST api and hosted it on heroku. And when users try to login, register or perform CRUD operations in their accounts, requests are made to the api, necessary changes are made and data is stored in the database. Vanilla JavaScript and Sass were used on the frontend. And the frontend code is hosted on Netlify.

## Usage
---

## Backend

There is an `api` folder in the root directory of this repo which contains our REST api code.
Official Documentation of the api can be found [here](https://jaycodist.github.io/muses-backend-docs)


## Frontend
- Run `npm install` to install dependencies
- Run `npm start` to start the development server
